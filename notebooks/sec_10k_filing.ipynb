    "## Long-Form Document Extraction: Mining Information from SEC 10-K/Q Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies listed on the US stock exchanges are required to file annual and quarterly reports with the SEC. These reports are called 10K (annual) and 10Q (quarterly) filings.\n",
    "10K/Q filings are information dense and contain a lot of information about the company's business, operations, and financials.\n",
    "The documents have a loosely defined structure and the reported metrics and sections may differ based on the company's operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, there are enough commonalities that we may want to extract the information in a standardized format for downstream analysis. e.g. this could be \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at Nvidia's 10-K filing for the year 2024. Here's the SEC link for the [10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm).\n",

    "### 1. Defining the Extraction Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we'll focus on extracting the following information from the 10K/Q filings which are common across different companies:\n",
    "- *Filing Information*: Date of filing, type of filing, reporting period end date, fiscal year, fiscal quarter\n",
    "- *Company Profile*: Name, ticker, reporting currency, stock exchanges, auditor\n",
    "- *Financial Highlights*: Key metrics to assess the company's financial health - revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, EPS, EBITDA, free cash flow\n",
    "- *Business/Geographic Segments*: Revenue, operating income, year-over-year growth, outlook for each segment.\n",
    "- *Risk Factors*: Key risks as identified by the company management.\n",
    "- *Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A)*: Key highlights from management discussion and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Pydantic Models for Schema Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use JSON to define the schema for the extraction or use Pydantic models to encapsulate the schema. In this example, we'll use Pydantic models for schema definition for a few reasons:\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: They are more flexible, easier to extend and maintain. \n",
    "- **Readability**: Pydantic models are more readable (less verbose) and easier to understand. Nested models in particular are easier to read than deeply nested JSON schemas.\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: By validating against the Pydantic model, your code is guaranteed to be type-safe for use downstream an part of an automated process. e.g. an extracted date field will not suddenly become a numeric type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, imagine that you have a daily ETL pipeline that searches for new 10-K/Q filings and extracts the relevant information for these companies. Once the extraction results are available in LlamaExtract, *it is guaranteed to comply with the schema definition and can be sent to the ETL pipeline without worrying about data type mismatches.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider some key design considerations for the schema definition below."

    "\n",
    "- **Optional Fields**: There are quite a few optional fields in the schema. There are many fields that we would like to extract if present, but we know that they are not present in all filings. \n",
    "  e.g. companies which only has a US footprint will not have a geographic breakdown of their financials. It is important to designate these fields as optional so that the LLM is not \n",
    "  forced to make up values for these fields. Designating these fields as optional helps provide an escape hatch for the LLM to not hallucinate values for these fields. Note, however, that if aggressively marking fields as optional might result in the LLM being overly lazy and not attempt to extract information for these fields. So there's a balance in what fields to mark as optional! \n",
    "- **Descriptions for Fields**: While not mandatory, it is always a good idea to provide a description for each field. This helps the LLM understand the context in which the field is being extracted and can improve the accuracy of the extraction.  \n",
    "- **Enums**: We use enums to limit the possible values for a field. e.g. the `FilingInfo` model has an enum for the possible values of `filing_type`.  \n",

The large and growing number of developers and installed base across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers. We committed to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for offices and data centers under our operational control starting with our fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2024, we made progress towards this goal and increased the percentage of our electricity use matched by renewable energy to 76%. By the end of fiscal year 2026, we also aim to engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA’s scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions with the goal of effecting supplier adoption of science-based targets. As of January 26, 2025, revenue related to remaining performance obligations from contracts greater than one year in length was $1.7 billion, which includes $1.6 billion from deferred revenue and $151 million which has not yet been billed nor recognized as revenue.
